# WHOIS
This is a simple tool I created to help me out with my day to day WHOIS searches. It asks the user for the IP to WHOIS search. It also converts the country code into the full country name.

#Usage

*MUST BE RAN ON A LINUX SYSTEM WITH PYTHON3 INSTALLED*
<code>
chmod +x whoissearch.py

./whoissearch.py

#Status

There are currently some bugs that cause the function that converts country codes to full names. This is due to how the WHOIS command has various types of output.
